# Threesodas
5 years of programming. Started in 2017 with C#.<br>
I never learned to program in school, it's all self-taught,<br>so I'm not as smart as you might think.<br>
C# and JS developer.<br>
## CS work
I pour most of my C# knowledge into WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation).<br>Sometimes Unity, sometimes console applications.
<br>I don't do much of C# work anymore because I focus mainly on Javascript development.
## JS work
In addition to web development (which also includes HTML and CSS), I also do Javascript.<br>
Most of my Javascript work is [Discord](https://discord.com) bots.<br>
[See my upcoming Discord bot](https://github.com/Soft-Drinks-Software/SodaBot)
